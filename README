This MATLAB code accepts a WAV file, seperates it into small time intervals known as grains, applies a Hanning window, and generates two output files and sets of output waveforms. 

The first set of outputs rebuilds the original audio file from the grains of seperated audio, and is intended to be sonically and visually identical to the input. 

The second set of outputs rebuilds the grains into a random ordering, resulting in a new signal that is comprised of the original input but does not resemble it. 

The concepts demonstrated here are the underlying principles of granular synthesis.
